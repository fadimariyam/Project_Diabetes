Overview:
   The Diabetes Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) Algorithm project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of  an individual developing diabetes.The dataset includes several features related to an individual's health such as glucose level,blood pressure,insulin level and other related factors.Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values,normalizing the data and splitting it into training and testing.The KNN algorithm works by finding the 'K' nearest data points to a given test point and  classifying it based on the majority class of those neighbors. In this project, the KNN algorithm classify patients into two categories: Diabetics and Non-Diabetics   

Result:
  The final outcome of this model is a prediction of diabetes for each individual based on their input features.

Benefits:
  Early Detection,Cost Efficiency,Accessibility
